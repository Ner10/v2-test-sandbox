# Accordion Component

The Accordion component provides an expandable/collapsible container that helps organize content into digestible sections, saving valuable screen space while keeping related information accessible.

## Basic Usage

Accordions are perfect for FAQs, product specifications, or any content that benefits from progressive disclosure.

<Accordion title="What is Once UI?">
  Once UI is a comprehensive design system and component library built for modern web applications. It provides a collection of reusable components, design tokens, and patterns to help developers build consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I install Once UI?">
  You can install Once UI using npm or yarn:
  
  ```bash
  npm install @once-ui/react
  # or
  yarn add @once-ui/react
  ```
  
  Then import components as needed in your application.
</Accordion>

## Customization Options

The Accordion component supports various customization options:

- **Size**: Control the overall size with the `size` prop (`s`, `m`, or `l`)
- **Icon**: Change the default chevron icon with the `icon` prop
- **Radius**: Adjust corner rounding with the `radius` prop
- **Initial state**: Control whether it's initially open with the `open` prop

## Implementation Example

Here's how to implement a custom accordion group:

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: 'import { Accordion, Column } from "@/once-ui/components";\n\nexport function FAQSection() {\n  return (\n    <Column gap="m">\n      <Accordion\n        title="How do I reset my password?"\n        size="m"\n        radius="m"\n      >\n        Visit the login page and click on "Forgot Password". Follow the\n        instructions sent to your email to reset your password.\n      </Accordion>\n      \n      <Accordion\n        title="Can I change my username?"\n        size="m"\n        radius="m"\n      >\n        Yes, you can change your username in your account settings.\n        Note that username changes are limited to once every 30 days.\n      </Accordion>\n    </Column>\n  );\n}',
      label: 'FAQ Accordion Group',
      language: 'tsx'
    }
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

## Accessibility Considerations

Our Accordion component follows WAI-ARIA best practices:

1. Uses appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
2. Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space)
3. Maintains focus management during interactions

Accordions are a powerful way to organize complex information while keeping your UI clean and focused.
