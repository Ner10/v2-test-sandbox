# Once UI Components

Once UI provides a comprehensive set of components designed to help you build beautiful, accessible, and responsive user interfaces. This guide introduces the key components and shows how to use them in your projects.

## Component Philosophy

Our components follow these design principles:

1. **Accessibility First**: All components are built with accessibility in mind
2. **Responsive by Default**: Components adapt to different screen sizes
3. **Customizable**: Flexible props system allows for extensive customization
4. **Consistent**: Unified design language across all components

## Key Components

Here's a quick overview of some of our most commonly used components:

<Table data={{
  headers: ["Component", "Purpose", "Key Features"],
  rows: [
    ["Card", "Container for related content", "Flexible layout, hover states, interactive options"],
    ["Accordion", "Collapsible content sections", "Animated transitions, keyboard accessibility"],
    ["Feedback", "User notifications", "Multiple variants (success, error, warning, info)"],
    ["SmartImage", "Enhanced image display", "Lazy loading, aspect ratio control, zoom capability"]
  ]
}} />

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of using our components together:

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: 'import { Card, Text, SmartImage } from "@/once-ui/components";\n\nexport function ProductCard({ title, description, image }) {\n  return (\n    <Card padding="m" radius="l" shadow="m">\n      <SmartImage src={image} alt={title} aspectRatio="16/9" />\n      <Text variant="heading-strong-m">{title}</Text>\n      <Text variant="body-default-s">{description}</Text>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}',
      label: 'Product Card Component',
      language: 'tsx'
    }
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

In the following sections, we'll explore each component in detail.
