# Card Component

The Card component provides a flexible container for grouping related content and actions. Cards are commonly used for dashboards, product listings, and information displays.

## Basic Usage

Cards can contain various types of content including text, images, and interactive elements. They support different visual styles through props like `border`, `shadow`, and `radius`.

<Card
  padding="l"
  radius="l"
  shadow="m"
  border="neutral-alpha-medium"
>
  <Text variant="heading-strong-m">Card Title</Text>
  <Text variant="body-default-m" marginTop="s">
    This is a simple card with text content. Cards are versatile containers that can be used to group related information.
  </Text>
</Card>

## Interactive Cards

Cards can be made interactive by adding the `href` prop, which transforms the card into a link:

<Card
  padding="l"
  radius="l"
  shadow="m"
  border="neutral-alpha-medium"
  href="#"
  horizontal="space-between"
  vertical="center"
>
  <Text variant="heading-strong-m">Interactive Card</Text>
  <Text variant="body-default-s" onBackground="neutral-medium">Click to navigate</Text>
</Card>

## Implementation Example

Here's how to implement a card with an image and text:

<CodeBlock
  codeInstances={[
    {
      code: 'import { Card, Text, SmartImage } from "@/once-ui/components";\n\nexport function FeatureCard() {\n  return (\n    <Card\n      padding="l"\n      radius="l"\n      shadow="m"\n      border="neutral-alpha-medium"\n    >\n      <SmartImage\n        src="/images/feature-image.jpg"\n        alt="Feature illustration"\n        aspectRatio="16/9"\n        radius="m"\n      />\n      <Text variant="heading-strong-m" marginTop="m">Feature Title</Text>\n      <Text variant="body-default-m" marginTop="s">\n        Description of this amazing feature and how it benefits users.\n      </Text>\n    </Card>\n  );\n}',
      label: 'Feature Card Component',
      language: 'tsx'
    }
  ]}
  copyButton
/>

Cards are highly customizable and can be adapted to fit various design requirements in your application.
